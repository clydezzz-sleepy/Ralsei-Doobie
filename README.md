# Doobie Ralsei Desktop Assistant (Shimeji)

A silly little desktop companion project featuring Doobie Ralsei. Just for fun! (Don't take over his extreme smoking addiction, though...)

## About
Hello, there! I am 'clydezzz-sleepy' on GitHub (the creator of this little curse), I'm glad to have you read this, even if that might not be required.
I'm content to have you use this little project of mine, even if it may have no physical use whatsoever. It's just something I liked making in the meantime, that's all!
Either way, I hope you have an amazing day and I hope you'll somewhat enjoy having this... Doobie Ralsei... on your desktop. Ehehe.
But, one thing I do need to note is that this might happen and I can't quite do much about it, but it is easily fixable:

# Note About 'assets ;p' Folder
There is a bug that I've personally experienced with clouds like Google Drive and others, they simply restrict the semicolon from their file/folder names, unfortunately.
This makes the name, 'assets ;p' get renamed into 'assets _p', which I currently do not have the sufficient knowledge of how to control/prevent the folder name being renamed.
My code for this little... (could you call it a tool..?) has partly hardcoded paths due to obvious reasons, if the program cannot find the 'assets ;p' folder, then it won't be able to run either. You'll have to manually rename the folder in order for you to be able to actually start it up properly.
This is how you can fix it (very easy, only two steps):

# How To Fix
1.	In the current folder (the project you downloaded), look for a folder named 'assets _p', it should be recognizable enough, it's in one subdirectory above the main tree.
2.	When you find the folder, right click on the folder and click 'Rename', now you'll be able to change 'assets _p' to 'assets ;p'.
Doing this manually will restore the correct folder name so the program can find necessary assets.

Happy... doobie! :3
